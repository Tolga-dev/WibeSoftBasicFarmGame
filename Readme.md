# BuildingManager Class

## Overview

The `BuildingManager` class is a component for managing building-related anything in the game.
It does the behavior between controllers such as
`TileMapController`, `InputController`, `BuildingPlacementController`, and `BuildingCreationController`,
as well as interacting with the game's save data.

## Dependencies

The class interacts with several other components in the game, including:
- `TileMapController`: map grid and tile-related operations.
- `InputController`: user input to interact with the game.
- `BuildingPlacementController`:placement of buildings on the map.
- `BuildingCreationController`: creation of new building instances.
- `SaveManager`: loading and saving of game data.


## Functions

* **Placement**

### During Placement
in here, we can move houses with input, mouse and by clicking space it place on grid.

### Conflict Placement
in this picture, we can see that houses are placed on the same grid and it is not allowed.

### Set and Open Timer
in this picture, we can see that timer is set and it is counting down.

### Finish Placement
in this picture, we can see that timer is finished and houses are placed on the grid.

# ShopManager Class

## Overview

The `ShopManager` class is responsible for managing the shop in the game, 

## Dependencies
- `ShopSlotController`: managing shop slots, initializing and setting up items
- `ShopBuyController`: logic for the buying process, including purchasing items from the shop.
### Open Shop Panel And Check categories
in this picture, we can see that shop panel is opened and we can see the categories of items.

# InventoryManager Class

## Overview

The `InventoryManager` class is responsible for managing the player's inventory in the game.
It handles the interactions with inventory slots, currency updates, item usage, and item selling. 
## Dependencies

The class interacts with the following components:
- **InventorySlotsController**: Manages the slots in the inventory where items are stored.
- **InventoryCurrencyController**: Handles the currency system (e.g., gold, silver) and updates the currency UI.
- **InventoryItemController**: Manages the usage of items in the inventory.

## Conclusion

This architecture is designed to create a modular game structure.

### Future Improvements
- Add event-based communication between managers.
- Optimize controller logic for better performance.
- Implement a dependency injection system to improve modularity.
